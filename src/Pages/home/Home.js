          <h1>AIM OF PANCHTATWA</h1>
          <p>
            At Panchtatwa, our primary goal is to conduct research and re-search the ancient Vedic sciences,
            with a special focus on Vastu, Astrology, and other related fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            We organize classes, workshops, and seminars to promote Vedic wisdom across the country.
            Through social media and other networking platforms, we share knowledge on topics such as tithi (lunar days),
            the significance of festivals in Sanatan Dharma, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to bridge the gap between ancient Vedic wisdom and modern techniques. By integrating the study of the Vedas,
            Upanishads, and Puranas with modern tools like Lecher antennas, GDV cameras, and aura scanning technology,
            Panchtatwa ensures that students learn holistically.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further extend this mission, we have opened the Acharya Amlanand Shastri Sanskrit Vidyalaya.
            This institution offers a blend of traditional Vedic subjects alongside modern disciplines like mathematics,
            science, and computer studies. Our rishikumars (students) are equipped to master both ancient and contemporary knowledge,
            empowering them to perform pujas, karmakand, and deepen their understanding of the Vedas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated in the serene Garhwal Himalayas at Srinagar Garhwal, our ashram provides free boarding and educational
            facilities to all students, making ancient knowledge accessible to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, India was known as "Sone ki Chidiya", a golden bird of wealth, knowledge, and spirituality.
            A key part of this heritage is the Kailash Mansarovar region, which once formed part of the perfect North-East
            quadrant of India, as per Vastu principles. However, with this area now under Chinese jurisdiction,
            we believe this fundamental Vastu imbalance contributes to missed financial and spiritual opportunities for the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our long-term vision is to restore Indiaâ€™s full spiritual potential. While this may seem like a distant dream,
            we remain hopeful that one day, steps will be taken toward reclaiming this lost part of our heritage.
