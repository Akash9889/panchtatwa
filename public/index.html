      content="Panchtatwa connotes the “Panchmahabhutas” that is the five great elements of nature. The entire universe is made up of these five elements namely Earth Fire, Water, Air and Space. The human body is also made up of these five elements which are concomitant to our five senses of taste, smell, hearing, touch and site. Vastu is a Vidya which teaches the individual to live in synergy with these five elements of nature. It is the science of arrangement of the five elements in any given place."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
